# Project Title

AI voice assistant to manage PLC and HMI panels.
This project is aiming to assist people who are not familiar with PLC tags. 
A person can simply press a button and start talking into a microphone and ask what they want to do and the task is automatically done. (if it's previously programmed and defined in the PLC)

## Tools
- INMP441 microphone
- S7-1200 PLC (In our case we used TIA Portal)
- ESP32 microcontroller
- Any micro SD card slot module and a SD card(preferred)
- I2S Stereo Decoder (UDA1334A), if you need a real-time feedback from LLM. 


## Implementation Details

In this section, you will explain how you completed your project. It is recommended to use pictures to demonstrate your system model and implementation.


Feel free to use sub-topics for your projects. If your project consists of multiple parts (e.g. server, client, and embedded device), create a separate topic for each one.

## How to Run

In this part, you should provide instructions on how to run your project. Also if your project requires any prerequisites, mention them.
